 Your First Python Program 
 Flow of Control (Modules, Branching) 
 If, If- else, Nested if-else o Looping, For, While

Lab Assignments: 
Q.1. Using for loop, write and run a Python program for this 
algorithm. Here is an algorithm to print out n! (n factorial) 
from 0! to 10! : 
1. Set f = 1 
2. Set n = 0 
3. Repeat the following 10 times: 
a. Output n, "! = ", f 
b. Add 1 to n 
c. Multiply f by n 
 
Q.2. Modify the program above using a while loop so it prints out all of the factorial values 
that are less than 2 billion. (You should be able to do this without looking at the output of 
the previous exercise.) 
 
Session 3

begins on day 4 (Thursday): S

Q. 2. A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least 
once, for example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a 
function to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not. 
 
Session 4  
Lecture 
Dictionaries 
 Introducing Dictionaries 
 Defining Dictionaries 
 Modifying Dictionaries 
 Deleting Items from Dictionaries 
Lab Assignments: 
Q. 1. In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is a very simple encryption techniques in which each 
letter in the  plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the 
alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and 
so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his 
generals. ROT -13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher 
where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT -13 may be represented by means of the 
following dictionary: 
 
key = {'a':'n', 'b':'o', 'c':'p', 'd':'q', 'e':'r', 'f':'s', 'g':'t', 'h':'u', 'i':'v', 'j':'w', 'k':'x', 'l':'y', 'm':'z', 'n':'a', 
'o':'b', 
'p':'c', 'q':'d', 'r':'e', 's':'f', 't':'g', 'u':'h', 'v':'i', 'w':'j', 'x':'k', 'y':'l', 'z':'m', 'A':'N', 'B':'O', 'C':'P', 'D':'Q', 
'E':'R', 
'F':'S', 'G':'T', 'H':'U', 'I':'V', 'J':'W', 'K':'X', 'L':'Y', 'M':'Z', 'N':'A', 'O':'B', 'P':'C', 'Q':'D', 'R':'E', 
'S':'F', 'T':'G', 'U':'H', 'V':'I', 'W':'J', 'X':'K', 'Y':'L', 'Z':'M'} 
 
Your task in this exercise is to implement an encoder/decoder of ROT-13. Once you're 
done, you will be able to read the following secret message: 
 
Pnrfne pvcure? V zhpu cersre Pnrfne fnynq! 
Note that since English has 26 characters, your ROT-13 program will be able to both 
encode and decode texts written in English.

Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for 
"robber's language"). That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in 
between. For example, translate("this is fun") should return the string 
"tothohisosisosfofunon".
